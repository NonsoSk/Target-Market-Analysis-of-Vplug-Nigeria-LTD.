# Target-Market-Analysis-of-Vplug-Nigeria-LTD.


Hello Everyone,

I'm glad to present a task I carried out to practicalize all I've learnt about the use of basic; advanced functions and formular in excel.
Thus, this is an excel based project of the data gotten from **vplug-Nigeria-ltd** financial dataset. (The company's name as well as the dataset were all created for the sake of this task)

It evaluates the target market for the products produced by the company, as well as the segment and country where greater supplies are made. The goal is to help the company make proper decisions on where to situate its next branch, the best products to be supplied there and the segment to lay greater focus on.


## Skills demonstrated in this project

- Data Cleaning.
- Critical Thinking.
- Problem Solving.

## Problem Statement.

- To find out the country with the highest purchase of products
- To find out the best product to be produced in the country 
- To find the best segment as targeted audience.


## Data sourcing

After proper definition of my problem statement, I obtained the data by downloading the csv file from my drive and then imported and converted into an excel file. The data (Financial dataset) is a random dataset which was created by my instructor for the purpose of this class test. 
Data Cleaning
The financial dataset was not in a clean format, so I had to clean it before attending to the KPIs and all other subsequent analysis which were all done with excel.



## Analysis and Recommendation


Canada has always been the projected country for the new branch. However from our analysis, the following was discovered that the highest unit sold is **4493**, and was sold in the United states of America particularly in the Government segment. I was able to get this, using the 'max' function for the highest unit sold and the xlookup function to get the country and segment where this highest sales was made.
What this means is that, the government sector of The United States of America, consume the products from this company higher than other sectors, and the United States of America patronize the company well.
Thus, I recommend that the company sets her branch in the United States where the products are more appreciated.

below is a pictorial representation of the above:
